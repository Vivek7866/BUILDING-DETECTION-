1.SPACENET 

To download the data from spacenet ,we must have a aws account(root user)

Step1:-firstly install the awscli(cli:- command line interface)and then configure it
for configuration go that the account profile 
Step2:-find the security credentials then find the access key there if already created ,if not create a access key and preferably download the csv file becoz you may able to see th password only once ,to have a regular use you must download it ,then use that access key ID and SECCURITY ACCESS KEY OR PASSWORD FOR THE
configuration ,then they will ask for the area or region such as us-east-2 and the last output format such as text,json .means the output will be in json format 
step3:- after filling the info. in cmd prompt simply just copy paste the script provided at the site for downloading of the data.
step4:-after that downloading start and you may get a large zip file of the data.

I recommend to upload the zip file in drive because otherwise we need to need to upload such large file regularly which is tedious so upload it at drive ,then in colab mount the drive and the simply unzip the file in colab only 
which may save our time ,net and as colab run time is of 12 hours so it is better to do that only.
